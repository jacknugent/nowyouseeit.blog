The well-executed Netflix mini-series Queen’s Gambit boasts incredibly precise chess sequences, supervised in part by the legendary chess World Champion Garry Kasparov. Many articles and chess enthusiasts have showered their praises on the realistic portrayal of chess in the show. But what about the realism of the story itself? How realistic is, say, the story of an American woman becoming world chess champion in the 1960s?

Queen’s Gambit, based on a novel of the same name, is a work of fiction, but not far from the real thing. The Soviet’s did have a stranglehold on chess in the 60s, and an American did rise up from humble beginnings to beat them at their own game. The only real difference between reality and fiction is in the star of the show: in real life, a young man from Brooklyn named Bobby Fischer, and in Queen’s Gambit, an orphaned young woman named Beth Harmon.

The show established early on that chess was traditionally a man’s game. “Girls do not play chess,” said the orphanage janitor to a 9-year-old Beth, refusing to play her. But eventually, he did play her. And she was good. Really good. So good, in fact, that she quickly rose through the ranks of the chess world, proving herself a chess prodigy.

So, how did the show approach the fact that Beth Harmon was a woman in a game dominated by men, in a time period of intense sexism? In short, the show kept it light. The first few episodes touched on but ultimately watered down the intensely sexist history of the game. At Beth’s first chess tournament, the boys initially scoffed at her playing and paired her with the only other girl competing. But once those boys realized she had talent, her gender no longer mattered much. Even Beth herself hoped it didn’t matter, criticizing an article written about her that focused too much on the fact that she's a woman.

But the show leaves a question unanswered. If chess is such a meritocracy, where any prodigy will quickly rise through the ranks as a superstar, then why does the life of Beth Harmon only exist in fiction? Why did not a single woman compete in the World Chess Championships in the 20th century?

The US probably had unknown chess prodigies living in orphanages around the country in the 1960s. The US probably had many incredible chess players who were women and/or people of color. But none ever rose to the top of the chess world, because these groups were essentially banned from competitive play. A woman like Beth would have had continuous, unrelenting harassment at every tournament. Many tournaments would not allow her to play at all, and many men would likely refuse to play her, no matter how good she was. Even a person as tough as Beth would have given up in such a system. Eventually, it simply wouldn’t have been worth it.

Bobby Fischer, Beth Harmon’s real-world, male counterpart, also came from humble beginnings and rose to the top of the chess world, besting the top Soviet players. “Men and women shouldn’t play together,” said teenage Fischer in 1961, right around when fictional Beth Harmon would have been improving her game at the orphanage, “I don’t think [women] should mess into intellectual affairs, they should keep strictly to the home.”

One of the following must be true: either women in the 1960s weren’t smart enough or tough enough to be chess prodigies, or the chess world was so hostile to women that it was impossible for them to operate within it. But all we needed was one woman with the brains and guts to take on the chess patriarchy, right? Wouldn’t we all like to think so.

Given the show’s pitch-perfect chess playing and its story of a US prodigy against the Soviet chess machine, it may feel tempting to think that Beth Harmons story fits into the realm of the realistic. But the sad truth is that a realistic portrayal of a female chess prodigy in the 1960s would be depressing, uninspiring, and certainly no fun to watch.

We live in a world where TV-goers intensely scrutinize the “accuracy” of a show. Gone are the days of silly, cartoonish hacking sequences. Now, we have Mr. Robot. The over-the-top courtroom dramas got replaced with Better Call Saul, and the gruesome, yet charming criminal underworld of The Sopranos became the calculated, by-the-books world of Ozark.

But in an age where Movies and TV have slowly but surely given more historical accounts of women and people of color, those accounts haven’t endured the same quest for realism.

“I hate all civil rights movies,” said Chris Rock, in an interview with fellow comedian Neal Brennan, “I applaud the effort, and they should exist. The problem is, they only show the back of the bus and the lunch counter. They actually make racism look very, like, fixable.”

And perhaps the blame for this reduction of sexism and racism cannot simply go on the creators of these films, but partly on the very nature of narrative storytelling. Stories like Queen’s Gambit are bound by the rules of the Hero’s Journey. Even if Harmon doesn’t win in the end, she still must have some obstacle to overcome, some lesson to learn. Would there be anything to learn or overcome in a story of unrelenting, brutal sexism?

In the end, a factually accurate story of sexism in chess would have been simply unwatchable, because in reality, sexism is unbearable to watch. And there’s no money to be made in unwatchable TV shows, so we are left with tepid sexism that Beth can overcome with some brains and hard work, achieving the ultimate fantasy of the classical liberal.

But I still thoroughly enjoyed Queen’s Gambit, and I agree with Chris Rock that these stories should exist. Is there a time and a place for entertaining media with non-traditional stories, even if they may withhold some of the true weight of their ordeals? I certainly hope so. I see a lot of fun and value in watching a non-default character become the default hero.

And yet, I am reminded of the game of chess itself. The Queen is the most powerful piece on the board, able to move all spaces in any direction. But despite her incredible ability to win games, she will always remain less valuable than the King, a weaker but much more important piece. Those are the rules of the game.

So in the end, does Queen’s Gambit make a sacrifice? Yes. But in service of what? And in service of who?
