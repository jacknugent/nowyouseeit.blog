On March 19th, 2020, Gal Gadot tweeted what will go down in history as perhaps the most disliked video of 2020. In the video, A-list celebrities performed a sing-along for the purpose of spreading hope during Covid lockdowns. The result was the most tone-deaf messaging since Marie-Antonneite’s supposed “Let them eat cake” comment, and let’s not forget what happened to her (she was cancelled).

Both of these historical events featured out-of-touch socialites appearing to not understand the problems with their messaging. In our modern version, rich celebrities seemed to overlook that, by being rich, they do not feel the pains of coronavirus in the same way that most Americans do, what with their access to decent healthcare, spacious L.A. mansions, and the blood of young children. The end result was a universally panned, condescending trainwreck.

In a media landscape that profits off of division and the decay of political institutions, there’s something strangely comforting about the entire world joining together to agree, in unison, that this ain’t it, chief.

The celebrities’ song of choice, John Lennon’s “Imagine,” added further insult to injury. These wealthy actors sang lyrics like “imagine no possessions,” despite owning lots of possessions. They asked others to “imagine” a better world, which wasn’t a great strategy for those struggling through a very not-imaginary pandemic. Top 1 percent-ers benefit the most from Capitalism, and yet, they sing a song about “sharing all the world,” a song Lennon described as “virtually a Communist Manifesto.”

On the surface, “Imagine” seems like a song that completely contradicts Gal Gadot and her rich friends. But, upon closer inspection, it actually compliments them quite nicely. “Imagine” is a song about ending greed and sharing wealth, sure, but who wrote it? John Lennon, the millionaire. In fact, he wrote the song at his home, a 72-acre estate with its own recording studio (sounds like a great spot for an artist to quarantine). Demographically, he fits right into the Gal Gadot crowd.

As Communist as the song appears, it didn’t have any political impact. Did the producer of the song really think he would create social change by producing “Imagine”? On the contrary; he described the song as “very commercial.”

And he was right. “Imagine” is vague enough to become a generic anthem of hope without promoting any actual change. And that’s by design; John Lennon may have been a hippie and a political troublemaker, but he and his production team were well aware that a song that tried to start a Communist revolution would be controversial, potentially dangerous, and, most importantly, catastrophic to their bottom line. Lennon, unlike Lenin, just wanted a hit. “Put your political message across with a little honey,” he said when describing the song. A message sweetened with honey indeed, so sweetened that the song now gets played at every charity event and Olympic game. Note the title of the song -- it doesn’t even ask the listener to do anything, only to imagine.

With this framing of “Imagine” in mind, the Twitter celebrity video should come as no surprise. Really, it was inevitable. It is the perfect song for celebrities to spread tepid hope in an out-of-touch way because it’s so vague, mainstream, and watered down. And honestly, if John Lennon executed the song poorly, he could have suffered the same fate as his modern celebrity counterparts. A millionaire asking listeners to imagine a world without possessions? A little condescending, to say the least. But Lennon executed his song tastefully, and “Imagine” has become a beloved classic.

It appears that, when presented in the right way, the public enjoys art that tastefully challenges the status quo, makes an enormous profit, and keeps the social order nice and tidy.

Look no further than the movies. In the last few years, several Box Office hits and Oscar darlings took a stab at class critiques. There’s Parasite, a Korean film embraced by American moviegoers, which makes the case that poverty follows the poor wherever they go. There’s also Us, where each above-ground habitant is tethered to a powerless member of the under-class. Even film bros got Joker, which has its own in-world rioting against the rich elite.

Remember when critics thought that Joker would inspire real-world violence? Not only were they wrong, but they undoubtedly increased ticket sales in the process. Those critics made the same error as Gal Gadot: entertainment profits from the status quo.

Joker wasn’t made by incels; it was made by executives, the kind that Arthur Fleck shot on the subway. “Imagine” wasn’t written by a communist; it was written by a popstar. Joker didn’t inspire real-world violence, and “Imagine” didn’t inspire real-world change.

Gal Gadot’s video made obvious a crucial reality -- people with lots of money don’t benefit from drastic change. They benefit from the imagining of drastic change, because that makes the 99% happy, and that makes the 1% money.

It’s fun to see celebrities put in their place, but more crucially, this video is a gentle reminder that one must not look to the top for change at the bottom. When executed well, artists make their message very sweet, but maybe their message also requires a grain of salt.

But we love this stuff. We love catchy songs and “thoughtful” movies created by the powerful one percent. It’s societal junk food -- tasty, consumable, profitable. Gal Gadot’s video was one flop in a sea of Supermarket staples. The social change advocated in Hollywood and the music industry is often as lacking in nutrition as Gal Gadot’s video, just with much better packaging.

We’re all familiar with the healthy options: donating time and money to the causes you believe in, making informed political decisions, or, the most radical and pretentious option of all, reading a book.

But those are boring. I want entertainment. I want to escape.

I want to sit back, relax, and Imagine.
