Why are sequels so often letdowns? By comparing specific examples of successful and terrible sequels, we'll get some insight into how to make a good sequel.

In a detailed analysis of specific films, we explore the power of a character achieving the impossible: flight.

I was inspired heavily from Chapter 15 of "How To Read Literature Like a Professor" by Thomas C. Foster. It's a great starting point for a variety of tropes in literature and film.

Thanks again for the help, Andrew.
