Quentin Tarantino embraced the classics and elevated them to a new level in his genre movies, creating something entirely unique. His directorial control and incredible knowledge of cinema from all over the world allows him to twist universal movie tropes into new, innovative stories.

 “The story of a genre. The three stories in Pulp Fiction are more or less the oldest stories you’ve ever seen: The guy going out with the boss’ wife and he’s not supposed to touch her -- that’s in The Cotton Club, Revenge. The middle story, the boxer who’s supposed to throw the fight and doesn’t -- that’s about the oldest chestnut there is. The third story is more or less the opening three minutes of Action Jackson, Commando, every other Joel Silver movie -- two hit men show up and blow somebody away. Then, they cut to “Warner Bros. Presents” and you have the credit sequence, and then they cut to the hero three hundred miles away. Here, the two killers come in, BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-- but we don’t cut away, we stay with them the whole rest of the morning and see what happens to them . The idea is to have these old chestnuts and go to the moon with them.” Quentin Tarantino Interviews, pg. 78
