I have been thinking about making this video for years, researching it for months, and editing it for weeks. I even [made an entire page showing all the stripes I've found](/stripes).

I thought I'd include my [script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sXcAcufnHQqquAlmq2Av_yXxRXnjYcMeiaPRTWab6Ls/edit?usp=sharing), and a few additional resources.

Books:

- [The Devil’s Cloth: A History of Stripes](https://www.amazon.com/Devils-Cloth-History-Stripes/dp/0743453263/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1537531815&sr=8-1&keywords=the+devils+cloth) — The most incredible resource I had. Starts from the medieval times and goes all the way to the present day. Absolutely incredible, fun read.
- [Rayures: Une histoire des rayures et des tissus rayés](https://www.amazon.com/RAYURES-histoire-rayures-tissus-ray%C3%A9s/dp/2020236664/) — The Devil’s Cloth in French. But most importantly, it has the incredible pictures the English version is so sadly missing. Great book for the coffee table to make you look super smart. Basically gave me all the medieval paintings.
- [Stripes: Design Between the Lines](https://www.amazon.com/Stripes-Design-Between-Linda-OKeeffe/dp/1580933416/ref=sr_1_28?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1537532384&sr=1-28&keywords=stripes) — Where Pastereaou focuses on history, this book focuses on architecture and design. Visually stunning book that actually sites The Devil’s Cloth. Made the connection between the changing meaning of stripes and Jailhouse Rock (1957)
- [Stripes (Communicating With Patter)](https://www.amazon.com/Stripes-Communicating-Patterns-Mark-Hampshire/dp/2940361150/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1537532166&sr=8-1&keywords=stripes+mark+hampshire) — Good visuals, the explanations are kind of vague. A good companion to The Devil’s Cloth.

Stripes not mentioned in the video:

- The Athletic Stripe. Think Adidas (their new slogan “the company with the three stripes”) and Nike. Stripes convey speed. Gives a cunning side to the stripe. Even the prostitutes and jesters, in stripes, give off a sense of speed.
- The Maritime Stripe. Barely mentioned, but the Navy crew wore stripes, and England adopted the style, associating it with the beach. This style quickly spread around the world, and fits nicely with the association of stripes and hygiene. After all, the beach is a form of bathing and leisure.

> _“Nature has striped the zebra. Man has striped his flags and awnings, ties and shirts. For the typographer, stripes are rules; for the architect they are a means of creating optical illusions. Stripes are dazzling, sometimes hypnotic, usually happy. They are universal. They have adorned the walls of houses, churches, and mosques. Stripes attract attention.”_

I love that quote from the creator of the IBM logo, Paul Rand.
