The Wachowskis became international sensations with their second film The Matrix, but their directorial debut deserves just as much love. Bound is my favorite movie of all time because of how fresh it feels. There's really no other movie like it, which explains why it's The Greatest Lesbian Gangster Heist Movie Ever Made.
