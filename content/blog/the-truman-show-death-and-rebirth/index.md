Water is necessary for life, but what does it represent in film? In this video, we explore The Truman Show (spoilers) and many other films to see how water can be a powerful symbol of death and rebirth for a character.

This video borrows heavily from Chapter 18 of How To Read Literature Like a Professor. I highly recommend reading at least chapters 1, 2, 16, 17, and 18 because they relate as much to film as they do to literature.

Special thanks to Andrew for peer revising my drafts.
