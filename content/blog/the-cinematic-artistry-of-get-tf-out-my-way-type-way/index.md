In this installment, I analyze not a movie, not a TV show, but a viral dance video: Casey Frey's "Get tf out my way type way." This seemingly simple viral video deserves close inspection because of its masterful editing, camerawork, and storytelling. I'm surprised nobody else has analyzed it in detail before.
