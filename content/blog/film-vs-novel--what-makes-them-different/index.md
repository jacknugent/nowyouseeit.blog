Some film adaptations of novels become better than the novel. Some, no matter how good, can't capture the heart of the novel. Why? Let's look at the nature of the two art forms and what makes them different, or the same.

Movies (in loose order):
Dumb and Dumber (1994)
Life of Pi (2012)
Silence of the Lambs (1991)
Fight Club (1999)
The Wizard of Oz (1939)
As Good As It Gets (1997)
American Psycho (2000)
Superbad (2007)
The Hunger Games (2012)
The Great Gatsby (2013)
Fargo (1996)
Saving Private Ryan (1998)
A Clockwork Orange (1971)
