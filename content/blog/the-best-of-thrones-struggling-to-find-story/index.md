Game of Thrones was always a show that seemed impossible to end. It’s large cast of characters, separate plot threads, and violent world make for a show that defies traditional storytelling structure. But it’s ending nonetheless. So as part of the Best of Thrones collaboration, I wanted to look at a defining moment for the show. The season 6 finale The Winds of Winter was the shows first step towards finding an end. Let’s see what this episode tells us about Game of Thrones as a show and what to expect from the series finale.
