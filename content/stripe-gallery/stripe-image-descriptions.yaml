The interpretations are straighforward, the only one that deserves mention is the vampire's stripes, which symbolize her demonic quality and also her social deviance.
  The shot I provided also has images of tigers, represent danger and power in the drug-dealer's house."

Alice's dresses so far in the movie have has some stripes but they have been paired with a light blue color. These stripes paired with a bold tri-colored dress makes Alice both stand out and thus fit in with the Queen of Heart's court.  *Also I really enjoyed your video and I can't stop spotting stripes since! *"

  description: Tate is almost exclusively shown wearing stripes most often are green vertical stripes. This could be paying homage to his idol Kurt cobain as Kurt wore them as a sign of rebellion witch Tate identifies with. I more likely think it’s because he he is a prisoner of his own actions and faults, therefore much like the old strip jumpsuits he wears them a almost like a prison uniform. however the argument could be made that he wears them as a sign of innocents and purity witch is ironic as he is not.

  since it's the future and everyone is connected to \"the system\" in a way it represents the high customization of our characters while at no point losing the cage that you are in and that allows no escape. at a higher level it can also mean that to \"escape\" one only needs to refuse the system, to take off the implants or contact lenses or whatever they use. \"the cage\" being in itself artificial but nobody having the power to distinguish between what is real and what is not.
I havent seen the movie yet. but thanks for augmenting my reality by making a video about it. i cant show you how the mannequins change but i think it's cool. "

He's the only one wearing stripes in this scene and in the previous scene he's the only one wearing vertical stripes. The interesting thing is though, that the stripes become most obvious in this scene. Increasing his deviance from just being a black cop to someone who wants to pursue an almost impossible task. That is to make a white officer imitate as him in front of the KKK.

When Michel stays in Patricia's apartment and wears her similarly striped robe, a gender role reversal is performed in which Michel is made to be on an equal level of visual power and thus emotional power to Patricia.

It surely has a childish dimension, as she is in a way displayed as naive, and when she wears a subtly striped shirt of her boyfriend, it definitely has a pajama character. But in my opinion it foremost symbolizes perfectly how she is deviant and outstanding, her striped dresses are very eye-catching, but at the same time she tries to fit in – wearing the "marin" as a very typical french garment as an American in Paris

This could be a sign of Elio's youth and reinforces how much younger he is than his love interest Oliver, who predominantly wears plain garments. Suggesting that Elio's character is still maturing and could be considered naive.
  Similarly, the use of patterned and striped swimming costumes that are worn in the film by the younger characters such as Elio and his girlfriend Marzia, compared to Oliver, suggests a split between the young, naive and the old, mature characters. With the story following Elio's relationship with Oliver, the contrast in outfits and in particularly stripes emphasises this affair."

In this specific scene Oliver had just performed oral sex on Elio, erasing any doubt in Elio's mind as to whether Oliver had feelings towards him or not. The stripes here are red and bold and they pop out more than any other of the predominately blue pieces of clothing he wears throughout the film. It symbolizes his confidence, his acceptance, his freedom from having escaped a place of sexual covering up.

Goh Peik Lin takes her to her closet and they try out many different options. They settle on a gold, tan, blue, red, and pink dress that multiple people comment on saying she looks fashionably Egyptian. I think that this choice of a striped dress was very intentional in that it not only contrasts with the very oriental pallet, style, and pattern of the other people's clothing and the scenery around them, it also makes her stand out as a foreigner and arguably causes one to associate her with the USA. It's a bold choice that reinforces that she is seen by everybody as an outcast.

All of the childhoods of the group are deviant childhoods with abuse and violence. The round windows and blue walls seem extremely childish, and the parental figures seem jarring and extremely intrusive but at the same time extremely childish .

Thorkilds father wears striped shirt, then striped bathrobe and at the end a red striped pyjamas while Thorkild is wearing a blue pyjamas all along.
Arne's father is violent and abusive, and is fat, wears thin red stripes on white undershirt along with overalls and eating an apple.
Peters father is wearing very neat striped shirts as part of a businesslike attire and he has given Peter an extreme punishment and refuses to stop it.
Stefan's has the most 'normal'-looking childhood, and his cleanliness-obsessed mother wears a white dress shirt which has been pressed giving the illusion of thin lines. We don't even see it until the end of the scene.

See if you can find this movie, it's one of the best danish movies of the noughts, pretty much defining a multitude of movies that followed."

  description: Poppy, the main character, wears stripes throughout the film. I think mostly to show her playful nature and her colorful personality. Her slightly rebellious side shows up in the fashion choices she makes in almost every scene, but her red and white striped shirt stands out the most. In this scene, she is going to a dance class for the first time and is trying to have fun while everyone else, especially the teacher, is taking it very seriously.

  description: "Fred and George Weasley wear stripes throughout the Harry Potter movies. When in muggle clothes, they can often be seen wearing sweaters or shirts with light colored, often yellow, stripes. These are deviant characters, always breaking the rules, but they are ultimately more child-like in their deviance. Later, when they leave Hogwarts to start their own joke shop, they can be seen wearing brown pinstriped suits. This is to signify that they are now adults breaking society's rules, professionally. However, rather than a cold black or gray, the suits are a warm brown to represent that their deviance is still good-natured .

In Order of the Phoenix, they can be spotted wearing stripes at least four times. The first when Harry arrives at Grimmauld place and the twins are seen with yellow striped shirts. Second, at Christmas, they are wearing striped sweaters AND striped scarves. Third, they can be seen wearing bold, large stripes when they inform Harry that they intend to leave Hogwarts - which ends up being the most trouble they've ever caused. Finally, they are wearing thinner stripes of red and blue as they make their flashy exit from Hogwarts."

  description: When Harry arrives at 12 Grimmauld Place, Ron and Hermione are both wearing stripes. Perhaps it is to make them stand out from the gloomy background, and maybe the fact that they are both wearing stripes hints at their relationship. Since Harry isn't wearing stripes, it could also act as a visual representation of how Harry feels separated from the other two, as he has been left out of the loop and frustrated.

  title: Harry Potter series
  file: Harry.Potter.series.jpg
  description: "Let's get nerdy. The theme of questioning authority runs throughout the series. In the first few movies the main characters are just children. Playful adventure, trouble-making, and mischief occurs throughout. The pedagogy of Hogwarts allows for the students to be given a lot of leeway when they break rules. But they quickly learn an important lesson--that not all adults can be trusted. As problematic as the school's lack of disciplinary policy is, these experiences do turn out to prepare the students well for what is coming  .

In the early films, stripes appear in the bright ties and scarves that are part of the students' uniforms. My interpretation is that even though there is a structure (these are uniforms after all) there is also this sense of play and adventure in the pattern and colors, which seem to mirror the school and the way magic itself is portrayed. Magic, in this world, is both wondrous and knowable--there is such a thing as \"magical theory\".

Because the students have already practiced questioning authority, it feels natural to them to react by organizing a resistance movement once the Ministry of Magic (governing body of the wizarding world) becomes obviously corrupt. In the later films, as the students grow into young adults, they are shown more and more often in their own clothing, instead of uniforms. As they grow older they are able to think for themselves (and dress themselves), yet they still frequently choose to wear stripes. This is so frequent that it is very noticeable as a viewer, especially in the later movies and there are even memes and articles about it: (http://www.mugglenet.com/2015/08/7-harry-potter-characters-who-wore-stripes-a-lot/). This maps onto the meaning of stripes presented in your video, as they are rebelling against the government in these scenes. If stripes represent rebellion, boldness, standing out and standing up for oneself, then it is fitting that the members of a resistance movement are wearing this pattern."

  description: This is a mini-series not a movie, but interestingly the 2017 movie also uses stripes. In this version the stripes are colourful, more in common with what a clown would traditionally wear. Clown costumes are similar to that of the jester, indicating both silliness and strangeness, that a person is different from the rest of the group. The bright colours and stripes are especially eye-catching to children, making it an ideal outfit for It, as his aim is to attract the attention of children in order to kill them. It is interesting that in the 2017 remake his outfit is primarily white and red, maybe because a colourful outfit was not deemed 'scary' enough.

Adding red stripes on his white make up - which creates a high contrast - makes him even more terrifying. (This also applies to Natalie Portman in 'Black Swan', even though that make up has a black to white contrast).

  description: "Megan Fox's character, Jennifer wears stripes twice: once before and once after her demonic transformation. Both times, however, she is using her sexuality to entice those around her. She is a powerful creature with great mystique. In the first example, we see her veneer; the popular, apex predator, mean girl (a contrast to her prior introduction wherein she exchanges a cutesy wave with her best friend-girlfriend Needy) prowling the halls, aware of the gazes she is receiving from the Letterman jacket-clad jocks, matching their glances before ultimately ignoring them in favour of her primary target of the entire movie, the aforementioned Needy, whom she convinces to abandon her plans with her boyfriend to spend time with Jennifer herself. In the second example, post-demonic possession, the first time we see her actively pursue a man to consume, she clearly manipulates him using both her sexuality and his emotional vulnerability. In both examples she is wearing stripes."

This is evident in many scenes throughout the film, but some instances would be the screenshot I've included, as well as the car scene with her mom, her audition scene, and the final scene of the film. I believe the stripes coincide with her rebellious demeanor. Upon researching this, I noted that many coming-of-age films and tv shows feature characters in stripes as well, probably alluding to these characters often feeling like outcasts in society. This is seen with Juno, as exemplified in your video.

  description: in multiple scenes Lady Bird is seen wearing stripes. I think it’s similar to Juno in that t shows a “rebellious teen who commands attention.” I also think since we see her in uniform a lot, it shows how she contrasts from those limits, the same way she contrasts from her home town. Interesting side note, i’ve seen a lot of stripes in teen/ya clothing lately, perhaps due to lady bird’s success. The photo attached is from the final scene, but there’s multiple times, one when she gets a call from Jenna at her house, another when she kisses Kyle at a party, there’s probably others too.

  title: Жизнь за жизнь (Life for a Life) 1916
  file: Life.for.a.Life.1916.jpg
  description: "Bold vertical black and white stripes 32:00 - 32:26 on the skirt of the female protagonist, Nata, played by Vera Kholodnaya - the most popular melodrama actress of the time in Russia. The skirt is revealed dramatically by the removal of a dark coat, after which she steps into the light and then kisses her adoptive sister's husband, with whom she has a complicated past. She has worn this to meet him clandestinely, a section which is preceded by intertitles saying 'On the forbidden path'. The use of the stripe here suggests deviance and creates a dramatic moment in the shedding of the coat, symbolising commitment to something she knows is wrong. Bold vertical black and white stripes again appear on Nata's hat, 40:00 - 40:55, when she comes to see her sister about the arrest of the previously mentioned husband. This again shows her as a knowing adulteress, almost a mark of her acts, and reminds the audience of the scene previously witnessed. The same hat is worn by her in a scene soon after, 42:53 - 43:17, the end of the film. A different interpretation for this film could be that she is rebelling against the normal 'proper' behaviour expected, as throughout the film it is the sister's husband who is the villain as he only married the other sister as she had more money (Nata is adopted and so is not as rich), with Nata and her emotions victim to this, however this is a less clear-cut theory. Sorry if the image is not high quality enough, but it is a very striking moment. Here is the link on youtube for you to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0v6sRiZJs&t=2s"

  title: Revolutionary Girl Utena-episode 33 (1997)
  file: Revolutionary.Girl.Utena-episode.33.1997.png
  description: This stripe is red and white, and within the series its significance is very clear. RGU tackles gender roles and the most prominent is the dismantling of the prince and princess archetypes. Within the series these roles and their ideals are represented in colors. Red means love, passion, it represents certain characters as a sort of calling card-but it also represents "the whore" or "the woman in red". The woman who is blamed for what a man does, the woman who falls out of line within her role. White represents purity, godliness, princeliness. In this scene, our protagonist Utena is on her way home from a night out with the chairman of her school. She is 14. Unknowingly, she was raped, and "tainted" by him-at least in his eyes (as hypocritical as that sounds). The show tells you from the beginning that Utena has vowed to become a prince herself. She aspires to "save princesses" and live up to a noble (and unrealistic) standard. Here she is feeling like something is horribly wrong. She feels like she has been violated, like something was taken from her. Her striped outfit reflects this. Her once princely demeanor has been sullied by this man, who has made her impure to this world. The chairman is always in a red button-down.

  description: "I actually watched your video like an hour before my friends and I randomly decided to rewatch The Hangover and I couldn't believe what I saw. At the beginning of the film, Stu and Melissa are shown both wearing stripes. Stu is actually wearing stripes on top of stripes; a button down shirt with vertical stripes and a sweater over his shoulders with horizontal stripes that slightly mimic Melissa's own horizontal-striped shirt. The striped sweater on his shoulders is like a visual representation of her influence over him, and it clashes with his shirt just as her personality clashes with his. If you've seen the film you'll know this couple is highly dysfunctional and Stu and Melissa are, on the whole, two people who shouldn't be together. Their clothes match that  .

P.S. Throughout the rest of the movie Stu slowly loses his stripes. Within ten minutes the sweater around his shoulders is gone, but the thick vertical stripes on his shirt still look like prison bars to me. Later on, he wears a white shirt with two horizontal stripes. Only towards the end of the movie do we see him in a solid-colored orange shirt.

Love your videos!! Never thought I would be writing this much about nuances in The Hangover haha "

I feel like this is because when I watched this show Arnold was kind of perceived as a loser/ outcast to me.  Arnold is different because he is always doubting himself and never wants to go on Ms. Frizzles field trips.  (I know you asked for movies but, I couldn't let this one go.)

  description: When detective Sam Spade visits his client Ruth Wonderly/Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the multilayered multi-deceptive femme fatale, they're in a louvered room with horizontal blinds and two striped armchairs, and she's wearing a striped dressing gown. It's naughty stripe galore. Spade suspects her and is attracted to her; she lies to him (on many levels) but also needs his protection. On top of it all, the room itself foreshadows (or is a mockup of) the prison she'll end up in at the end of the story.

  I think the outfit change in this film is very important, since both (the black and white stripes of the suit and the original red and white solid santa-clause outfit) have traditional symbolisms. "

  Orderly checkerboard patterns are used everywhere in the movie. It makes the use of stripes in this scene all the more apparent and effective.

(I'll be honest. I really just wanted to give Richard Williams a little love. Please give him a shout-out if you ever make a video on the checker pattern.)

Thank you for the time and effort you always put into your work.

May you have a fun and wonderful day. :) "

Most importantly, Viridiana always wears jackets on top of a squared blouse until the final scenes, but that is outside the scope of your search. Sometimes her blouse can seem striped from certain angles, but we should probably dismiss those frames."
