description: "I actually watched your video like an hour before my friends and I randomly decided to rewatch The Hangover and I couldn't believe what I saw. At the beginning of the film, Stu and Melissa are shown both wearing stripes. Stu is actually wearing stripes on top of stripes; a button down shirt with vertical stripes and a sweater over his shoulders with horizontal stripes that slightly mimic Melissa's own horizontal-striped shirt. The striped sweater on his shoulders is like a visual representation of her influence over him, and it clashes with his shirt just as her personality clashes with his. If you've seen the film you'll know this couple is highly dysfunctional and Stu and Melissa are, on the whole, two people who shouldn't be together. Their clothes match that.

P.S. Throughout the rest of the movie Stu slowly loses his stripes. Within ten minutes the sweater around his shoulders is gone, but the thick vertical stripes on his shirt still look like prison bars to me. Later on, he wears a white shirt with two horizontal stripes. Only towards the end of the movie do we see him in a solid-colored orange shirt.

Love your videos!! Never thought I would be writing this much about nuances in The Hangover haha "
