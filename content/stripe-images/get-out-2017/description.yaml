description: Rose Armitage, portrayed by Allison Williams, wears a red-and-grey striped shirt.  The stripes are mostly portrayed for her character to be flashy until she reveals herself as one of the main antagonists to her "boyfriend" Chris, who is portrayed by Daniel Kaluuya. Chris does not realize that Rose deceives him when she admits that she cannot give the car keys to him to leave her parent's house.
