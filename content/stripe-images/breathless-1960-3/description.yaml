description: Patricia (Jean Seberg) is dressed in stripes in almost every scene in this movie, and that's a lot of outfits. It surely has a childish dimension, as she is in a way displayed as naive, and when she wears a subtly striped shirt of her boyfriend, it definitely has a pajama character. But in my opinion it foremost symbolizes perfectly how she is deviant and outstanding, her striped dresses are very eye-catching, but at the same time she tries to fit in â€“ wearing the "marin" as a very typical french garment as an American in Paris
