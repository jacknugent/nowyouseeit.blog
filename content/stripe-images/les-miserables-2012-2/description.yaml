description: The Thérnardiers are frequently shown wearing vivid stripes on their outfits. The Thérnardiers are both the comic relief characters of the musical and a pair of sleazy criminals, liars, cheats, and opportunists. It makes sense then, as deviants even amongst the poor and low class that they be distinguished by such a jarring pattern.
