description: "The protagonist, Elio Perlman is usually wearing striped t shirts, contrasting from the the older characters who are usually in plain shirts. This could be a sign of Elio's youth and reinforces how much younger he is than his love interest Oliver, who predominantly wears plain garments. Suggesting that Elio's character is still maturing and could be considered naive.
Similarly, the use of patterned and striped swimming costumes that are worn in the film by the younger characters such as Elio and his girlfriend Marzia, compared to Oliver, suggests a split between the young, naive and the old, mature characters. With the story following Elio's relationship with Oliver, the contrast in outfits and in particularly stripes emphasises this affair."
