description: "Viridiana wears stripes ocassionaly through the film. Some of the hoodlums wear stripes consistently. The sexually advancing cousin wears a striped tie and sometimes a striped jacket. Interpretation is dubious.

Most importantly, Viridiana always wears jackets on top of a squared blouse until the final scenes, but that is outside the scope of your search. Sometimes her blouse can seem striped from certain angles, but we should probably dismiss those frames."
