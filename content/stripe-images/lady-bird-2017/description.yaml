description: Lady Bird, or Christine, wears many outfits throughout the film that feature stripes. This is evident in many scenes throughout the film, but some instances would be the screenshot I've included, as well as the car scene with her mom, her audition scene, and the final scene of the film. I believe the stripes coincide with her rebellious demeanor. Upon researching this, I noted that many coming-of-age films and tv shows feature characters in stripes as well, probably alluding to these characters often feeling like outcasts in society. This is seen with Juno, as exemplified in your video.
