description: "one of the first shots into the movie. futuristic AR(augmented reality) costumes that change in stripe patterns on two mannequins in front of a store.
since it's the future and everyone is connected to \"the system\" in a way it represents the high customization of our characters while at no point losing the cage that you are in and that allows no escape. at a higher level it can also mean that to \"escape\" one only needs to refuse the system, to take off the implants or contact lenses or whatever they use. \"the cage\" being in itself artificial but nobody having the power to distinguish between what is real and what is not.
I havent seen the movie yet. but thanks for augmenting my reality by making a video about it. i cant show you how the mannequins change but i think it's cool. "
