description: Not a movie I know, but one of the best albums and bands in history, I believe. It has a very clear stripes as the background for the cover, leading to the band standing out a lot and showing the rebellious side of Blondie and the punk movement, as they were all seen as delinquents who didn’t fit in. Showing us that side of music and preparing us for what you listen to in the songs from that album. For example, Debbie, the lead singer, talks about getting and trying to lose a stalker in “one way or another”, showing the bad side of fame and beauty.
