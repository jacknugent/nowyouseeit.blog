description: Suit with stripes worn by Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) @02:55 in the movie. Displayed through the clothing worn by the characters in the film where Marshall and other people (ex. Sam Friedman (portrayed by Josh Gad) who is jewish) wear stripes to represent their status in society. Especially noticeable how Marshall start to wear less noticeable stripes throughout the runtime of the movies, signalizing a change in society's perception of him.
