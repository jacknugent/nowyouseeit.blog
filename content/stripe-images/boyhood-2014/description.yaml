description: Most of the outfits worn by young mason is a striped shirt. Mason as a child consistently had a variation of the striped shirt that marked his youthfulness. As the film progresses and Mason gets older we see fewer instances of the striped shirt in exchange for hoodies and plaid shirts. The final scene is a graphic T-shirt as a stark contrast of the striped shirt marking the end of his journey through "Boyhood"
