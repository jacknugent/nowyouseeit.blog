description: In Crazy Rich Asians, Rachel Chu goes to (If I remember correctly) Singapore to attend the huge party that her boyfriend's family is throwing at his childhood home, but she first visits one of her best friends Goh Peik Lin whose family ridicules her outfit for being too basic and cheap for the extremely wealthy and chic lifestyle of this very rich family. Goh Peik Lin takes her to her closet and they try out many different options. They settle on a gold, tan, blue, red, and pink dress that multiple people comment on saying she looks fashionably Egyptian. I think that this choice of a striped dress was very intentional in that it not only contrasts with the very oriental pallet, style, and pattern of the other people's clothing and the scenery around them, it also makes her stand out as a foreigner and arguably causes one to associate her with the USA. It's a bold choice that reinforces that she is seen by everybody as an outcast.
