description: The main character's antagonist, the brilliant detective L, is seen multiple times sitting in a striped chair. The colors range from red and yellow to black and white. This could symbolize that L is a lying monster, as he confesses to being one when talking to the kids in Whammy's House. L is also clearly a social deviant, going against all social norms (sitting oddly, chewing fingernails, being frank no matter the consequences). He also admits to being childish.
