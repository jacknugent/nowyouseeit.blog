description: "gloves - Coraline begs her mom for striped gloves, but she says no, and later the Other Mother gives her a pair.
button eyes - the button eyes come in a stripey gift box.
Other Mother's evolved form - when the OM goes completely ape she has a huge black & white striped web Coraline almost gets trapped in.
Stripes are associated with the Other Mother and danger, like a caution sign. The stickier the situation Coraline finds herself in, the more stripes there are and the more dramatic they are."
