description: "During the childhood flashbacks, all the father's (and one mother) wear stripes and all the houses have round windows and blue walls. Most noticeably in Thorkilds childhood, Thorkilds fathers pyjamas get more and more colourful, while Thorkild goes from light stripes, to very green stripes, to a single red shirt, the colour his mother has worn throughout the sequence, but has stopped wearing for the last scene. All of the childhoods of the group are deviant childhoods with abuse and violence. The round windows and blue walls seem extremely childish, and the parental figures seem jarring and extremely intrusive but at the same time extremely childish.

Thorkilds father wears striped shirt, then striped bathrobe and at the end a red striped pyjamas while Thorkild is wearing a blue pyjamas all along.
Arne's father is violent and abusive, and is fat, wears thin red stripes on white undershirt along with overalls and eating an apple.
Peters father is wearing very neat striped shirts as part of a businesslike attire and he has given Peter an extreme punishment and refuses to stop it.
Stefan's has the most 'normal'-looking childhood, and his cleanliness-obsessed mother wears a white dress shirt which has been pressed giving the illusion of thin lines. We don't even see it until the end of the scene.

See if you can find this movie, it's one of the best danish movies of the noughts, pretty much defining a multitude of movies that followed."
