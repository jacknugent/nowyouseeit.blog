description: This stripe is red and white, and within the series its significance is very clear. RGU tackles gender roles and the most prominent is the dismantling of the prince and princess archetypes. Within the series these roles and their ideals are represented in colors. Red means love, passion, it represents certain characters as a sort of calling card-but it also represents "the whore" or "the woman in red". The woman who is blamed for what a man does, the woman who falls out of line within her role. White represents purity, godliness, princeliness. In this scene, our protagonist Utena is on her way home from a night out with the chairman of her school. She is 14. Unknowingly, she was raped, and "tainted" by him-at least in his eyes (as hypocritical as that sounds). The show tells you from the beginning that Utena has vowed to become a prince herself. She aspires to "save princesses" and live up to a noble (and unrealistic) standard. Here she is feeling like something is horribly wrong. She feels like she has been violated, like something was taken from her. Her striped outfit reflects this. Her once princely demeanor has been sullied by this man, who has made her impure to this world. The chairman is always in a red button-down.
