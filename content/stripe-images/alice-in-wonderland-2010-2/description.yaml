description: "These black stripes are featured on a red, white, and black dress Alice gets from the Red Queen. The Red Queen herself has many stripes both on her dress and on her head which makes sense given that she is quite a eccentric character. Alice's dresses so far in the movie have has some stripes but they have been paired with a light blue color. These stripes paired with a bold tri-colored dress makes Alice both stand out and thus fit in with the Queen of Heart's court.  *Also I really enjoyed your video and I can't stop spotting stripes since! *"
