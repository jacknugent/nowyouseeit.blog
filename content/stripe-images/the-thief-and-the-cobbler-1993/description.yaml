description: "Stripes are used during the chase scene. Used to convey the disorientation and unease of the chase.
Orderly checkerboard patterns are used everywhere in the movie. It makes the use of stripes in this scene all the more apparent and effective.

(I'll be honest. I really just wanted to give Richard Williams a little love. Please give him a shout-out if you ever make a video on the checker pattern.)

Thank you for the time and effort you always put into your work.

May you have a fun and wonderful day. :) "
