description: When detective Sam Spade visits his client Ruth Wonderly/Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the multilayered multi-deceptive femme fatale, they're in a louvered room with horizontal blinds and two striped armchairs, and she's wearing a striped dressing gown. It's naughty stripe galore. Spade suspects her and is attracted to her; she lies to him (on many levels) but also needs his protection. On top of it all, the room itself foreshadows (or is a mockup of) the prison she'll end up in at the end of the story.
