description: "Fred and George Weasley wear stripes throughout the Harry Potter movies. When in muggle clothes, they can often be seen wearing sweaters or shirts with light colored, often yellow, stripes. These are deviant characters, always breaking the rules, but they are ultimately more child-like in their deviance. Later, when they leave Hogwarts to start their own joke shop, they can be seen wearing brown pinstriped suits. This is to signify that they are now adults breaking society's rules, professionally. However, rather than a cold black or gray, the suits are a warm brown to represent that their deviance is still good-natured.

In Order of the Phoenix, they can be spotted wearing stripes at least four times. The first when Harry arrives at Grimmauld place and the twins are seen with yellow striped shirts. Second, at Christmas, they are wearing striped sweaters AND striped scarves. Third, they can be seen wearing bold, large stripes when they inform Harry that they intend to leave Hogwarts - which ends up being the most trouble they've ever caused. Finally, they are wearing thinner stripes of red and blue as they make their flashy exit from Hogwarts."
