name: Racing Stripes (2005)
file: Racing.Stripes.2005.jpg
description: The main character, Stripes, is a zebra. He is shown as being immature and ridiculous by the thoroughbreds on the neighbouring farm because he is an orphaned zebra that is not bred to race like the thoroughbreds. They ridicule how he looks because of his stripes versus their sleek largely single coloured coats.
