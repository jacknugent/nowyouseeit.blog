description: "Megan Fox's character, Jennifer wears stripes twice: once before and once after her demonic transformation. Both times, however, she is using her sexuality to entice those around her. She is a powerful creature with great mystique. In the first example, we see her veneer; the popular, apex predator, mean girl (a contrast to her prior introduction wherein she exchanges a cutesy wave with her best friend-girlfriend Needy) prowling the halls, aware of the gazes she is receiving from the Letterman jacket-clad jocks, matching their glances before ultimately ignoring them in favour of her primary target of the entire movie, the aforementioned Needy, whom she convinces to abandon her plans with her boyfriend to spend time with Jennifer herself. In the second example, post-demonic possession, the first time we see her actively pursue a man to consume, she clearly manipulates him using both her sexuality and his emotional vulnerability. In both examples she is wearing stripes."
