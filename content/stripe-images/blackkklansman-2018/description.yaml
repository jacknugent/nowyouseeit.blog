description: The main character is the only black cop in the precinct. In this scene, he's trying to convince his superior to let him carry out a crazy operation. He's the only one wearing stripes in this scene and in the previous scene he's the only one wearing vertical stripes. The interesting thing is though, that the stripes become most obvious in this scene. Increasing his deviance from just being a black cop to someone who wants to pursue an almost impossible task. That is to make a white officer imitate as him in front of the KKK.
