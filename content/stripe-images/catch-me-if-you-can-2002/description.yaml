description: Leonardo DiCaprio's costumes most of the duration of the film has some kind of stripes showing or signifying his thinking out of the box or challenging the status quo or his rebellious nature. It's subtle but it's there. Even the poster of the film has a name of the film written in a stripped pattern.
