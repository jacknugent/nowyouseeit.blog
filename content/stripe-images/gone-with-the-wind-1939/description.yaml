description: "One of Scarletts iconic dresses. Scarlett wears this dress while taking Baby Bonnie for a walk in the stroller as they discuss the future of their baby girl. This scene takes place in post war economy, so the movie did already do a lot of work establishing her deviant character. Also this scene is outside so it probably reflects the way people in her town see her.

Have fun with your list :)"
