name: Rocky (1976)

description: When Rocky Balboa loops his run of Philadelphia with the steps to the Philadelphia Art Museum, it's presented as a true triumph and sign of his strength as well as his perseverance. Not only is it what makes Rocky unique, but it's also an aspect of what makes his city unique (I say this as a Philadelphian). It's both a sign of Rocky's uniqueness and his ties to the city he was born and raised in.
