description: "Stripes in Jack Skellington's suit; Traditionally the character is considered mischievous or even evil; outfit changes when he is doing something considered 'good': being the christmas father; then changes back into the suit after he messes up.
I think the outfit change in this film is very important, since both (the black and white stripes of the suit and the original red and white solid santa-clause outfit) have traditional symbolisms. "
