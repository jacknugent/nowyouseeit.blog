description: "The girl, as the title suggests, is nearly always alone at night which might lead you to assume that she is the vulnerable person in the situation.  However, as a vampire, she is in fact the predator in most situations.  She is nearly always wearing a striped shirt which highlights her as a character as well as the fact that she is not what you, nor the characters she interacts with, expect."
