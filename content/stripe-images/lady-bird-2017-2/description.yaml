name: Lady Bird (2017)

description: in multiple scenes Lady Bird is seen wearing stripes. I think it’s similar to Juno in that t shows a “rebellious teen who commands attention.” I also think since we see her in uniform a lot, it shows how she contrasts from those limits, the same way she contrasts from her home town. Interesting side note, i’ve seen a lot of stripes in teen/ya clothing lately, perhaps due to lady bird’s success. The photo attached is from the final scene, but there’s multiple times, one when she gets a call from Jenna at her house, another when she kisses Kyle at a party, there’s probably others too.
