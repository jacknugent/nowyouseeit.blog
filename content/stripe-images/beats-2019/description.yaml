description: Johnno's shirt, in the scene where he storms off after dinner with his mum's boyfriend (and after, where he hears about the illegal rave from Spanner). It seems to be a rather clear symbol of his teenage impulse to rebel and break away from authority. It's the same in the scene where he disappears with Spanner to meet his anarchist friends; a striped shirt suggests rebellion
