description: There are stripes on Elio's shirt (narrow vertical stripes) and his 2 T-shirts (wider horizontal stripes,  blue and white, red and black). Might me a sign of his originality as a queer, both sensual and deep person and the way he feels about his place in society and his complicated relationship with Oliver. Significantly, Oliver also wears vertically striped shirts, but they are not as noticeable as Elio's.
