description: Will has been faced with his problem of not knowing how to cope with long term relationships for he always repels people who get close to him emotionally. Throughout the film he wears this white and beige stripe shirt which always appears in scenes where he is not adding positively to his objective of being at peace with himself and creating an enduring relationship with Skylar. He wears this when he is lying to her about his twelve brothers or when he is being interviewed by the NSA. Plain patters are the ones he wears when he is being himself and not using his smarts to change the past and get to comfortable situations.
