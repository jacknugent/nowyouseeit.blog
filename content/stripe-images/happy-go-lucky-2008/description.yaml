description: Poppy, the main character, wears stripes throughout the film. I think mostly to show her playful nature and her colorful personality. Her slightly rebellious side shows up in the fashion choices she makes in almost every scene, but her red and white striped shirt stands out the most. In this scene, she is going to a dance class for the first time and is trying to have fun while everyone else, especially the teacher, is taking it very seriously.
