description: Toby wears his striped onesie throughout the film. At the start of the film Sarah rejects Toby and calls him to be taken by the Goblin King, she is trying to banish the responsibility of children and fertility that comes with adolescence. She quickly realises that she doesn't want Toby to leave and is prepared to go through danger to embrace the dual opportunity/threat of adolescence, sexuality and fertility.
