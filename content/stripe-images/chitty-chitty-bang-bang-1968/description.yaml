description: Stripes are used throughout the movie not only on the car chitty chitty bang bang but also on the characters in multiple dress ups. The most eye catching scene in my opinion is the scene where the family are hiding from the child snatcher. The stripes in my opinion are supposed to represent childish nature as well as rebellion against the child snatcher as children aren't supposed to be free and they are using what are usually childhood toys to escape him.
