description: "Three characters wear stripes: the drug dealer uses an adidas-like striped jacket (common among this stock-type character), the vampire (played by Sheila Vand) wears during most of the film a striped blouse, and the kid has a mildly striped shirt. The interpretations are straighforward, the only one that deserves mention is the vampire's stripes, which symbolize her demonic quality and also her social deviance.
The shot I provided also has images of tigers, represent danger and power in the drug-dealer's house."
