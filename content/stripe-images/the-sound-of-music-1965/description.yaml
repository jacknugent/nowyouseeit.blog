description: "Maria (Julie Andrews) is a postulant. She doesnâ€™t follow how things are done and is constantly butting heads with the nuns at the abbey. Some see her in an extremely negative light. She is an outsider.

We see her wearing the stripes while she is singing on top of a hill in the first scene. We later see her in the abbey with the other nuns in her stripes. "
