description: Her red and white striped shirt (1 of 4 or 5 of the striped shirts she wears). She is asking her father (doctor) for money to help out someone for an abortion which was illegal at the time. This was her trying to "be accepted" by the "cool crowd" AKA Johnny, the guy she ends up getting with. The whole movie focuses on her growth and becoming an  adult, and at one point she tells her father something along the lines of "I am not who I thought I was, and neither are you"
