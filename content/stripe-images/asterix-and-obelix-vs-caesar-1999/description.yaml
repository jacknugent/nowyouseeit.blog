description: Obelix's character was originally created by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo in 1959 and has his recognizable striped high-waisted pants. He uses his superhuman strength in comical ways. He doesn't recognize the Romans as a threat but enjoys beating them up. His pants show his childishness and comical character.
