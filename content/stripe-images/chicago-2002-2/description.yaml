description: This scene is one one the most iconical in this musical, and I always noticed the use of color in it, but after your video I've also realised how there are a lot of stripes surrounding the women in prison, not only from the bars of the cells, but also from bed sheets, and clothes. To me, this is made to emphasize how the characters are sinners, criminals, and immoral.
