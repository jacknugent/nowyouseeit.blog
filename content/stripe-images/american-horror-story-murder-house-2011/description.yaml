description: Tate is almost exclusively shown wearing stripes most often are green vertical stripes. This could be paying homage to his idol Kurt cobain as Kurt wore them as a sign of rebellion witch Tate identifies with. I more likely think itâ€™s because he he is a prisoner of his own actions and faults, therefore much like the old strip jumpsuits he wears them a almost like a prison uniform. however the argument could be made that he wears them as a sign of innocents and purity witch is ironic as he is not.
