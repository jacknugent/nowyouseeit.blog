description: The stripes on the face of Pennywise creates a certain unease. People are already afraid of clowns, because it's harder to read their faces because of the paint or the mask. Adding red stripes on his white make up - which creates a high contrast - makes him even more terrifying. (This also applies to Natalie Portman in 'Black Swan', even though that make up has a black to white contrast).
