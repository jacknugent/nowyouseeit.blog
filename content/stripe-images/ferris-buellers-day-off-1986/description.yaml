description: "We see Ferris wearing his red and gray striped bathrobe at the beginning of the film when he’s talking directly to the camera and we see it at the end of the film when he instructs the audience to “go home.”

Anyone who has seen the movie knows that Ferris is an obvious troublemaker. He is despised by his sister and principal, but adored by pretty much everyone else. He shakes things up, makes people escape their comfort zone, and is continuously trying to get the most out of life even though it may cause hardships to others around him. "
