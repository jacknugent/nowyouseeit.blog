description: "Bold vertical black and white stripes 32:00 - 32:26 on the skirt of the female protagonist, Nata, played by Vera Kholodnaya - the most popular melodrama actress of the time in Russia. The skirt is revealed dramatically by the removal of a dark coat, after which she steps into the light and then kisses her adoptive sister's husband, with whom she has a complicated past. She has worn this to meet him clandestinely, a section which is preceded by intertitles saying 'On the forbidden path'. The use of the stripe here suggests deviance and creates a dramatic moment in the shedding of the coat, symbolising commitment to something she knows is wrong. Bold vertical black and white stripes again appear on Nata's hat, 40:00 - 40:55, when she comes to see her sister about the arrest of the previously mentioned husband. This again shows her as a knowing adulteress, almost a mark of her acts, and reminds the audience of the scene previously witnessed. The same hat is worn by her in a scene soon after, 42:53 - 43:17, the end of the film. A different interpretation for this film could be that she is rebelling against the normal 'proper' behaviour expected, as throughout the film it is the sister's husband who is the villain as he only married the other sister as she had more money (Nata is adopted and so is not as rich), with Nata and her emotions victim to this, however this is a less clear-cut theory. Sorry if the image is not high quality enough, but it is a very striking moment. Here is the link on youtube for you to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0v6sRiZJs&t=2s"
