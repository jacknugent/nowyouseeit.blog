description: This is a mini-series not a movie, but interestingly the 2017 movie also uses stripes. In this version the stripes are colourful, more in common with what a clown would traditionally wear. Clown costumes are similar to that of the jester, indicating both silliness and strangeness, that a person is different from the rest of the group. The bright colours and stripes are especially eye-catching to children, making it an ideal outfit for It, as his aim is to attract the attention of children in order to kill them. It is interesting that in the 2017 remake his outfit is primarily white and red, maybe because a colourful outfit was not deemed 'scary' enough.
