description: Black and white striped blouse used as the signature clothing item worn by Patricia (Jean Seberg); used to mark Patricia as chic, while also emphasizing the playful yet strong femininity that gives her license to spar with the masculinely brutish Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and not to be made subservient to him as he does to other females throughout the film. When Michel stays in Patricia's apartment and wears her similarly striped robe, a gender role reversal is performed in which Michel is made to be on an equal level of visual power and thus emotional power to Patricia.
