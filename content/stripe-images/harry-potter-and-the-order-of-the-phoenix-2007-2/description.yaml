description: When Harry arrives at 12 Grimmauld Place, Ron and Hermione are both wearing stripes. Perhaps it is to make them stand out from the gloomy background, and maybe the fact that they are both wearing stripes hints at their relationship. Since Harry isn't wearing stripes, it could also act as a visual representation of how Harry feels separated from the other two, as he has been left out of the loop and frustrated.
