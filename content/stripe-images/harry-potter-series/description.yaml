description: "Let's get nerdy. The theme of questioning authority runs throughout the series. In the first few movies the main characters are just children. Playful adventure, trouble-making, and mischief occurs throughout. The pedagogy of Hogwarts allows for the students to be given a lot of leeway when they break rules. But they quickly learn an important lesson--that not all adults can be trusted. As problematic as the school's lack of disciplinary policy is, these experiences do turn out to prepare the students well for what is coming.

In the early films, stripes appear in the bright ties and scarves that are part of the students' uniforms. My interpretation is that even though there is a structure (these are uniforms after all) there is also this sense of play and adventure in the pattern and colors, which seem to mirror the school and the way magic itself is portrayed. Magic, in this world, is both wondrous and knowable--there is such a thing as \"magical theory\".

Because the students have already practiced questioning authority, it feels natural to them to react by organizing a resistance movement once the Ministry of Magic (governing body of the wizarding world) becomes obviously corrupt. In the later films, as the students grow into young adults, they are shown more and more often in their own clothing, instead of uniforms. As they grow older they are able to think for themselves (and dress themselves), yet they still frequently choose to wear stripes. This is so frequent that it is very noticeable as a viewer, especially in the later movies and there are even memes and articles about it: (http://www.mugglenet.com/2015/08/7-harry-potter-characters-who-wore-stripes-a-lot/). This maps onto the meaning of stripes presented in your video, as they are rebelling against the government in these scenes. If stripes represent rebellion, boldness, standing out and standing up for oneself, then it is fitting that the members of a resistance movement are wearing this pattern."
