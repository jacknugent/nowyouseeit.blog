description: In the cartoon for children, Arnold is a student who is seen wearing a yellow and white stripped jumper for almost all of the episodes.  I feel like this is because when I watched this show Arnold was kind of perceived as a loser/ outcast to me.  Arnold is different because he is always doubting himself and never wants to go on Ms. Frizzles field trips.  (I know you asked for movies but, I couldn't let this one go.)
