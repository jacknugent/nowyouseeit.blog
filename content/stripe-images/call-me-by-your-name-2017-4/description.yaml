description: The stripes used in this specific clip appear more deliberate than stripes used in earlier scenes that seem to reflect more of the cultural, everyday stripes in 1980s Italy. In this specific scene Oliver had just performed oral sex on Elio, erasing any doubt in Elio's mind as to whether Oliver had feelings towards him or not. The stripes here are red and bold and they pop out more than any other of the predominately blue pieces of clothing he wears throughout the film. It symbolizes his confidence, his acceptance, his freedom from having escaped a place of sexual covering up.
